# Temporal Abstraction and Deep Learning for Time Series Classification

## Data 
The data used in this project comes from two sources: 
* The [UCR archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018), which contains the 129 univariate time series datasets. 
* The [MTS archive](http://www.mustafabaydogan.com/files/viewcategory/20-data-sets.html), which contains the 13 multivariate time series datasets.

## Code   
The code is divided as follows: 
* The [main.py](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/main.py) python file contains the necessary code to run an experiement for the raw data. 
* The [run.py](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/run.py) python file contains the necessary code to run an experiement for the data after TA. 
* The [utils_folder](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/utils_folder) folder contains the necessary functions to read the datasets and visualize the plots.
* The [classifiers](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/classifiers) folder contains nine python files one for 1D-CNN deep neural network.
* The [temporal_abstraction_f](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/temporal_abstraction_f) responsible for the transformation that converts the code to the HugoBot system and for the neural networks.
* HugoBot system [Hugobot](https://github.com/ShaharT1995/TSC-Project/blob/master/Hugobot) - performs the process of temporal abstraction
